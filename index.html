        <p class="odd">Working with Celebrate Ceylon was such a pleasure. From the moment I reached out to them till the day they
                sent
                me my ring. They were super responsive and answered all my questions.<br> - Rebecca S</p>
        <p class="even">I heard that natural ceylon stones are among the best and this is most certainly true! The ring i got my now
                wife
                is absolutely stunning!!<br> - Travis M</p>
        <p class="odd">I’ve been in love with this company. They aren’t kidding when they say their prices are the best. Do a
                comparison
                and see for yourself. All these other companies keep such a big margin for ready made pieces and I paid a
                fraction
                of the cost for a custom made one.<br> - Daniel B </p>
        <p class="even">I had a really amazing experience working with the team at Celebrate Ceylon. They were able to execute the
                ring I
                envisioned to perfection within an affordable price! Their attention to detail and timely responses made
                them a
                pleasure to work with.<br> - Donovan R</p>

        <p>All Celebrate Ceylon Jewellery is under warranty for the first 6 months after purchase for manufacturing
            defects.
            This warranty does not protect against pieces that have been recklessly worn or purposely damaged. With regular

            use.
            Repairs needed after 6 months from the day of purchase will be at the expense of the customer along with any
            shipping costs to Sri Lanka. Pricing for repairs will vary depending on the specific features of the ring.
            For any ring size changes, any expenses including shipping will be borne by the customer.</p>
