                <p>I’ve been in love with this company. They aren’t kidding when they say their prices are the best.

                    comparison
                    and see for yourself. All these other companies keep such a big margin for ready made pieces and I paid a
                    fraction
                    of the cost for a custom made one.</p><br>

        <p>All Celebrate Ceylon Jewellery is under warranty for the first 6 months after purchase for manufacturing
            defects.
            This warranty does not protect against pieces that have been recklessly worn or purposely damaged. With
            regular
            wear if there are any manufacturing defects, they will typically materialize within the first month or two
            of
            use.
            Repairs needed after 6 months from the day of purchase will be at the expense of the customer along with any
            shipping costs to Sri Lanka. Pricing for repairs will vary depending on the specific features of the ring.
            For any ring size changes, any expenses including shipping will be borne by the customer.</p>
